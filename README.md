# Point-of-Sale-Application (POS)-for-Ethiopian-Defense-University
This desktop application is built for Ethiopian defense university employee supermarket, where the staff and students buy comsumables with a discount price due to goverment subsidy. I see the cashiers and shop keepers complaining about manual and paper based product selling invoicing process. So I decided to build this POS desktop software to automate the shopping work. 

The sofware enables the shop keeper manage inventory, make necessary calculation of total cost, change and tax, print reciept and much more. I am still working to add more features to the app. 

You are all welcome and contribute to this app.
