# Supermarket Point of Sale Application

## Introduction

Hello, I am Siyum Tsega Balcha, the developer of this application. This is a Point of Sale (POS) application specifically designed for supermarkets. It aims to simplify the process of sales transactions and inventory management in a supermarket setting. This desktop application is built for the Ethiopian Defense University employee supermarket, where the staff and students buy consumables at a discount price due to government subsidy. I see the cashiers and shopkeepers complaining about manual and paper-based product-selling invoicing processes. So I decided to build this POS desktop software to automate the shopping work.

## Features

1. **Inventory Management:** Easily add, update, and track products in your supermarket.
2. **Sales Transactions:** Process sales transactions smoothly with an intuitive user interface.
3. make necessary calculations of the total cost, change, and tax, print receipts,
4. **Reports Generation:** Generate sales and inventory reports for better business decision-making.
5. I am still working to add more features to the app.
